our paper:Accelerated Transformer Model for Slip Detection in Robotic Grasping through Visual-Tactile Sensor Integration

Abstract:
This paper presents an accelerated Transformer model for slip detection in robotic grasping tasks. By integrating visual and tactile sensor data, our approach significantly enhances the stability and accuracy of robotic grasping in dynamic environments. We introduce a token reorganization strategy that improves the computational efficiency of the model while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results show that our method surpasses traditional Transformer and CNN-LSTM models in both accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating substantial improvements in slip detection tasks. This work provides a robust and efficient solution for real-time robotic applications that require reliable grasping strategies, advancing the capabilities of autonomous robots in handling complex manipulation tasks.
